      title: "How it works"
      paragraph1:  |
        Neufund's ICO is a call to commit capital to the Neufund
        Platform in exchange for tokens, that's why we call it ICBM
        - Initial Capital Building Mechanism.
      paragraph2:  |
        Reserve ETH in your personal Ethereum wallet. You have 18
        months to pick your favourite investments. Not investing
        results in full release.

      title: "Why participate: Neumark key feature"
      paragraph1:  |
        Neumarks entitle their holders to revenues from all the future investment's success fees. They also allow the holders to participate in the
        economic benefit from a platform portfolio of all the startups tokens that will ever launch.
      paragraph2:  |
        <strong> If you reserve you ETH now you are getting NEU for free, if not, to get NEU you have to invest in the startups first.</strong>
        You can capitalise on Neumarks by <i>hodling</i> or by trading without vesting on secondary market from day one.

  title: "Invest fully legally in ICOs of equity tokens or utility tokens in any company in the world"
  paragrapha:  |
        Using our legal and technical infrastructure, startups and established companies alike can legally issue a new type of asset we call tokenized equity –
        in essence, digital shares. We achieve this by formally linking paper contracts with Ethereum smart contracts through mutual reference and code correspondence.
        Neufund enables investment in tokens that represents rights other than equity, like utility tokens, protocol tokens, and any tokens backed by a SAFT agreement.
